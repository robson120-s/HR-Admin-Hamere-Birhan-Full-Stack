# State Management

This project uses a combination of React's built-in state management tools.

- **Component State (`useState`, `useReducer`)**: For managing local state within individual components, such as form inputs or UI toggles.
- **Context API (`useContext`)**: For managing global state that needs to be accessed by multiple components across the app, such as the authenticated user's information and theme settings.
