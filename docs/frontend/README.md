# Frontend Overview

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript.

- **Component-Based**: The UI is built from small, reusable components located in `src/components`.
- **Routing**: Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom` to navigate between different pages.
- **API Communication**: We use the `axios` library to make HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Styling**: All components are styled using PostCSS.
